The project is divided into three main components: Automated SMS System: Implemented a Python script that runs hourly sending SMS messages to recently discharged patients. Each message includes a personalized link to the feedback portal. Feedback Web Application: Created a dynamic emoji-based UI where patients can provide feedback. The portal includes an admin panel allowing administrators to create departments and modify questions as needed. Upon submission of feedback an automated email is dispatched to the relevant departments for review. Data Analysis Portal: Constructed a separate data analysis portal using the Streamlit framework and Python. This portal accessible only by authorized departments allows for in-depth review of feedback data. TechStack JavaScript HTML CSS Streamlit Django Oracle PostgreSQL Pandas NumPy Python Docker HELPDESK AND INVENTORY MANAGEMENT SYSTEM (HTMS) Developed a web-based Helpdesk and Inventory Management System for a hospital that enables users to log in any calls that come to the helpdesk and assign a technician to the job. The system also allows the caller to track the status of their call log. In addition authorized users can add or bulk add from Excel any asset to the hospital and update its status and user of the asset. This project demonstrated strong problem-solving collaboration and analytical skills as well as a deep understanding of software development principles and best practices allows for in-depth review of feedback data.
